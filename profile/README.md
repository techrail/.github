# Techrail

Techrail is a GitHub organisation, comprising of budding enthusiastic developers who are trying to build some meaningful open source software to fill gaps in the software world.

The two of the most active, fast-progressing and ready-to-use projects are: 

1. **[Bark](https://github.com/techrail/bark)**: It is a logging tool which is supposed to fill the gap between plaintext files and very large, terabyte-scale enterprise solutions for log aggregation and analytics (even reading that feels complicated, doesn't it?). Bark aims to be easy to install and use and allows you to _send your logs to PostgreSQL_ which you can then search easily using SQL, without having to learn a new query language.
2. **[Devta](https://devta.techrail.in/)**: It is a Developers toolset which aims to provide some handly everyday tools which we programmers need to use very often. From JSON parsing and formatting to Base64 encoding/decoding to playing with time formats and timezones, it has some great tools and we have more planned too!

Another of our ambitious projects which is currently in an infancy stage is a _Password manager tool_ named **KeySmith** which is supposed to have an **[iOS App](https://github.com/techrail/keysmith-ios)**, an **[Android App](https://github.com/techrail/keysmith-android)** and a **[Web Extension](https://github.com/techrail/keysmith-chrome-ext)**. The salient feature of this one is that it aims to have no server and instead stores all your data in encrypted format on your Google Drive and uses the same for syncing across all your devices!

There are a few more projects that we have. They have their own repositories where you can find their description or you can [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/aKkWFghPrV) where we would love to listen about what you think of them (any anything else you might have to say)!
